##1a.
    1. Printed is the result which is 20.
    2. Printed on line 13 is the same thing as before which is the result of 20.
    3. Prints the result or "values added" which is 20.
    4. Code returns an error, tried to access result when it was not in the same place it was defined 
    5. Results in an error because you try to return result which is a const and const can not be reassigned.
    6. Results in an error, same reason as 5.
##1b. 
    1. Helps output 3 as it returns the end of value of the forloop for console.log which in this case it length 3.
    2. Prints the final forloop pushed discounted price which is 300 so then it prints 300/2 being 150.
    3. Prints the value of 'finalPrice' which si the last finalPrice printed which is at the end 150
    4. Returns the array of prices at the discount given.
    5. An error occurs as i is "not defined" due to being called out of the block it was defined meaning it does not exist anymore.
    6. Error occours as discountedPrice is "not defined" as it's called out of scope it was defined.
    7. It returns 150 as the let is in the scope as it was defined before the forloop meaning it can return the finalprice.
    8. Returns the discounted prices of the array correctly.
    9. Error as you are trying to you a const variable for a forloop there by chaging the value which is not allowed for a const.
    10. Will succesfully print out the length as it was not changed as the prices length does not get modified returning a 3.
    11. Will succesfully return the correct array of discounted prices .
    12a. student.name
    12b. student["Grad Year"]
    12c. student.greeting
    12d. student["Favorite Teacher"].name
    12e. student.courseLoad[0]
    13a. 32, Integers mapt to exact string representation
    13b. 1, Completes the correct subtraction 
    13c. 3, Adding null causes to turn to 0.
    13d. 3null, concats the string instead 
    13e. 4, true maps to 1 so you add 3 and 1
    13f. 0, Adding 0 and 0 together causing another 0
    13g. 3undefined, concats the string 3 and undefined
    13h. NaN, undefined should not be compared to other values
    14a. true, string 2 becomes number 2 and compares
    14b. false, compares string lexographical instead letter by letter
    14c. true, compares string 2 becomes number 2 and compares
    14d. false, Does a stric comparision and does not convert string 2 meaning it's false
    14e. false, true becomes 1 and 1 does not equal 2
    14f. true, Boolean(2) is just true so it equals.
    15. === is a strict check that checks purely type, == is a non strict check they check value.
    16. Check part1b
    17. The array is modfied to the specifications of doSomething which is multiplying the object by 2 so it mutliplies each part of hte array by 2.
    18. Check file
